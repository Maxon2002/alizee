              Plump and meaty, with a rich, sweet, nutty flavor and delicate mineral notes — Gillardeau oysters are
              cultivated in the Marennes-Oléron region on the western coast of France and are considered among the
              finest
              in
              the world. Their taste is clean and balanced, without sharp salinity, and the texture is firm yet silky —
              each
              oyster melts gently on the palate.
              <br><br>
              We serve the oysters chilled on ice, carefully opened and retaining their natural brine. Accompaniments
              include a wedge of lemon, shallot red wine vinegar sauce, rye bread, and salted butter — all chosen to
              highlight the oysters’ natural depth and complexity.

              mustard, giving the salad a piquant and vibrant finish.

              flavors. Crisp kale leaves, creamy avocado slices, juicy orange segments, and the refreshing tang of
              pomegranate dressing come together in a light yet satisfying combination. It's a wholesome option that
              doesn’t compromise on taste — every ingredient contributes to a sense of balance and energy.
              <br><br>
              The preparation begins by marinating the kale in the pomegranate dressing to soften its texture and
              enhance its flavor. The salad is then gently assembled: avocado slices, orange segments, and pomegranate
              seeds are added with care to create both visual harmony and a layered, refreshing taste.

              The freshness of the sea meets the richness of the earth in the Alizée Salad. Juicy prawns, tender
              octopus, and calamari bring a distinct ocean flavor, complemented by the creaminess of avocado, the
              sweetness of heirloom tomatoes, and the light crunch of asparagus. Fragrant herbs and subtle woody notes
              of rosemary round out the profile. The result is a salad that’s both light and satisfying — a perfect
              balance of taste and nourishment.
              <br><br>
              The seafood is marinated in advance to enhance its flavor and tenderness, then gently combined with
              vegetables and fresh herbs. Just before serving, everything is dressed with a rosemary vinaigrette that
              ties the components into a vibrant and harmonious composition.

              Crisp, refreshing, yet rich — the endive and Roquefort salad plays on contrasts. The slight bitterness of
              endive pairs perfectly with the creamy sharpness of blue cheese, the sweetness of green apple, and the
              caramelized crunch of walnuts. Each element enhances the next, creating a harmony of flavors and textures

              dish.

              Raw meat as a culinary art form — beef tartare reveals the full depth of marbled Angus beef in its purest,
              most refined expression. Silky and cool, with bright notes of gherkins, shallots, and tangy mustard, each
              bite strikes a perfect balance between rich umami and refreshing acidity. The contrast of textures —
              tender beef against the crunch of toasted bread and fresh herbs — creates an elegant and memorable
              experience.
              <br><br>
              We prepare our tartare by hand, using finely chopped premium Angus beef mixed with capers, gherkins,
              shallots, parsley, and Dijon mustard. It’s served with crispy toasted bread so you can build the perfect
              bite — bold, savory, and delicately seasoned.

              Rich, velvety, and comforting — this mushroom soup reveals the deep, woody notes of wild mushrooms,
              enhanced by a creamy base and a subtle earthiness. A delicate truffle foam adds a refined aroma, while
              fresh chervil brings a light herbal touch. Every spoonful offers a harmonious balance of intense flavor,
              texture, and culinary finesse.
              <br><br>
              Wild mushrooms are first sautéed to a golden crisp to unlock their aroma, then gently simmered in a creamy
              base until tender. The soup is served with airy truffle foam, sautéed mushrooms, and warm brioche croutons
              that add a satisfying crunch and highlight the dish’s velvety texture.

              Mushroom and truffle tart seduces from the very first bite: the thin, crispy crust melts on the tongue,
              giving way to the rich flavor of forest mushrooms and a delicate creamy sauce. The subtle aroma of fresh

              The tart is prepared on a thin layer of crisp pastry with no edges. The base is covered with a velvety
              crème fraîche sauce, followed by white mushrooms, fresh black truffle, and a touch of fresh chives. Baked
              to a golden crisp and served hot — as an elegant appetizer or a light main dish.

              Crispy, juicy, and infused with the aroma of sage — Veal Milanese is a Northern Italian classic that

              notes, creating a harmonious and refined flavor experience.

              A whole cut of veal loin is pounded to the perfect thinness, coated in a sage-infused breadcrumb crust,
              and pan-fried in butter until golden and crisp. It is served with a fresh arugula salad and a rich veal
              jus, offering an elegant yet comforting dish.

              Juicy and rich in peppery flavor, the “Café de Paris” beef tenderloin brings the charm of a classic French
              bistro to the plate. The tender Australian beef melts in your mouth, while a bold blend of peppers adds
              intensity and depth.
              <br><br>
              The tenderloin is seared in olive oil with a trio of crushed peppers — Szechuan, green, and black —
              forming a fragrant crust. The pan is then deglazed with a peppercorn sauce to capture every nuance of
              flavor. The beef is returned to a copper pan, where it's finished with a touch of whipped cream and a
              sprinkle of pink pepper for an extra kick. Served with crisp, golden French fries, this dish is both
              elegant and comfortingly familiar.

              Sea Bream “en Papillote” is the very embodiment of tenderness and aroma. Baked gently in parchment, the
              fish slowly steams in its own juices with a touch of olive oil, lemon,
              tomatoes, and fresh basil — resulting in a delicate, almost ethereal flavor with bright Mediterranean
              notes. Roasted eggplant brings a velvety texture and a hint of smokiness, while baby potatoes add
              heartiness to the dish.
              <br><br>
              This classic French cooking method preserves the fish’s moisture and allows its full flavor to unfold.
              Served directly in its parchment “papillote,” the dish arrives fragrant and visually striking.

              Mussels marinière reveal the deep taste of the sea, with a tender texture and rich aroma. White wine adds
              a subtle acidity, shallots bring a touch of sweetness, and the Café de Paris butter — infused with herbs
              and spices — lends a creamy, gently spiced finish. The combination of briny mussels and velvety sauce

              The mussels are steamed in white wine with finely chopped shallots until they open fully, then finished
              with fragrant herb butter that envelops them in richness. Served with crispy French fries — perfect for
              soaking up every drop of the flavorful sauce.

              Grilled Canadian lobster is a true gastronomic luxury, offering a rich smoky flavor and tender, juicy
              meat. Cooked on the grill, the lobster retains its natural sweetness while gaining a subtle smoky note

              <br><br>
              To prepare, the live Canadian lobster is seasoned with salt and pepper, then grilled until it develops a
              golden crust and a distinctive smoky aroma. It is served with a mix of vegetables and a delicate
              Hollandaise sauce that perfectly complements the flavors.

              Tiger prawns have a rich, slightly smoky flavor thanks to a marinade of oil, salt, and pepper and grilling

              Bouillabaisse is a fragrant, deeply flavorful Provençal fish soup where marine and aromatic notes

              This bouillabaisse is made with a rich fish stock, mussels, baby potatoes, fennel, and orange zest. It's
              served with crispy croutons and saffron aioli, traditionally spread on the bread and dipped into the soup
              for an authentic taste of Marseille.

              Delicate celeriac risotto envelops the palate with its creamy texture and mild, slightly nutty flavor. The
              gentle sweetness of the celeriac root blends beautifully with juicy wild mushrooms and crisp asparagus
              stalks, creating a balanced and refined dish with a fresh herbal note from chervil.
              <br><br>
              Instead of traditional rice, finely chopped celeriac is slowly simmered in vegetable broth until it
              reaches a creamy consistency. Sautéed mushrooms, blanched asparagus, and fresh chervil are added at the
              end to complete the dish.

              Tender, slow-braised beef short rib melts in the mouth, perfectly paired with wide ribbons of pappardelle
              that soak up the rich, meaty sauce. The deep, comforting flavor of the beef is lifted by subtle tomato
              notes and a hint of garlic, while fresh parsley brings brightness and balance to this hearty dish.
              <br><br>
              The beef short ribs are slowly braised until the meat becomes fall-apart tender, then shredded and folded
              into a savory sauce made with tomato, garlic, and herbs. It's served over al dente pappardelle, whose
              broad shape holds the sauce beautifully. A final touch of fresh parsley adds freshness and rounds out the
              flavors.

              The dish entices with its creamy, velvety texture and rich, deep flavor. Delicate mushroom notes smoothly
              transition into the exquisite earthiness of fresh truffle, creating a layered aroma that unfolds with
              every bite. The creamy softness of Parmesan complements the dish, making it truly luxurious and refined.
              <br><br>
              The risotto is prepared traditionally: the rice is slowly simmered with onions and white wine, then
              aromatic mushrooms, herbs, and vegetable broth are added. At the end, butter and Parmesan are stirred in
              to achieve a silky texture. It is served with thin slices of fresh truffle, which enhance the flavor and
              make the presentation especially elegant.

              The tender, creamy sauce coats the rigatoni, unveiling the deep, slightly nutty flavor of rare morel

              The sauce is made from morels, shallots, garlic, chicken broth, and cream, combining to create a rich and

              the dish is garnished with fresh herbs and thin shavings of Parmesan for extra aroma and texture.
